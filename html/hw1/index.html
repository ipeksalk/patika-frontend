<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Ipek Salk. I live in Ankara with my cat Melahat. 
  I work as a software developer (mostly front-end) in an image processing company. 
</p>
<p>I love cats. I think they are most beautiful creatures in the world.</p>
<p>I am also interested in web development. Therefore, I want to advance and shape my career in this field.</p>
<p>
  I am very pleased to have participated in the practicum I attended with this collaboration of iyzico and patika.dev.

<h2>My Favorite Animals</h2>
<h3>Melahat</h3>
<p>I adopted Melahat when she was 2.5 months old.</p> 
<p>She is now 4 months old.</p> 
<p>The most loving cat I've ever seen.</p> 
<p>She is a very curious cat.</p>
<p>She loves to go anywhere and greets everyone with such comfort and kindness as if she has known them for a long time.</p>
<p>Spending time with her is a great pleasure for me.</p>
