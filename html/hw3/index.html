    <h2>How to Make San Sebastian Cheesecake (Basque Cheesecake)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
          <strong>Use full fat cream cheese.</strong> <br>Low fat cream cheese has a high water content and greatly affects the texture of a baked cheesecake. <br>Using full fat cream cheese makes the cheesecake creamy and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use full fat whipping cream.</strong><br>Don’t even think about substituting the heavy cream <br>for half and half – the extra fat is what gives this cheesecake it’s ultra creamy texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the eggs one at a time.</strong><br>In order to give the cheesecake an even texture, be sure the eggs are incorporated completely <br>by adding them one at a time and mixing well after each addition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use citrus and vanilla.</strong>Adding a touch of citrus zest to your cheesecake filling mixture adds a ton of flavour. <br>But it’s totally optional (and not always traditional in this recipe), so feel free to leave it out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use room-temperature ingredients.</strong>Make sure the cream cheese, eggs, and cream are at room temperature <br>in order to get the smoothest mixture possible.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Forget the crust.</strong>This San Sebastian cheesecake doesn’t have a crust, <br> skip straight to the filling!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Line the pan with parchment paper.</strong>Don’t forget to line your 9-inch springform pan well <br>with a piece of parchment paper. If you don’t you’ll be left with a stuck-on mess!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Don’t over bake.</strong>Remove the cheesecake from the oven when the edges are set but the centre is jiggly.<br> Don’t worry, it will set completely as it cools!
      </li>
      <li><strong>Enjoy your meal!</strong></li>
